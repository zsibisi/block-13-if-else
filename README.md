# block-13-if-else
Workshop:if/else

Hello there!

In this coding challenge, we will be using if/else if/else statements, logical operators, comparisons, and conditionals to solve four different prompts. We will create a Github repository named "block-13-if-else" and four files named "is-truthy.js", "number-line.js", "greater-than-5.js", and "pair-and-compare.js".

To start, we will pseudocode a logical solution to the prompt in the corresponding file with our partner. We will use if/else statements to create a flow that meets the prompt's requirements. Then, we will assign one partner to be the driver for the current question and start coding while console logging or debugging our solution.

Once we have completed the coding, we will test all given test values to make sure the solution works as intended. If it passes all test cases, we will move on to the next prompt and switch drivers.
